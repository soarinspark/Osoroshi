## What is this?

This is a joke dating sim created by a few high schoolers about themselves. If you came upon this project by any means other than them telling you about it, please ignore this.

## I'm One Of The Developers!

Awesome! Here's a quick rundown of what's what.

The game folder contains everything you probably need to worry about. script.rpy contains the code that runs when a game starts. The files in the characters folder contain the definitions of characters. The files in the scenes folder each represent a sequence within the game.

## A NOTE ABOUT SPACING

Because Ren'Py is based on Python, it has somewhat annoying requirements as to how you put spacing in lines of code. Make sure that you don't put any tab characters into any of the .rpy files, and also make sure that all lines that SHOULD have the same amount of indentation, do.

## Hey, can I change the styling?

NO! Not right now, anyway. Ren'Py uses a GUI editor for that, which is all well and good, but it means that any merge conflicts related to styling would be quite difficult to resolve.
